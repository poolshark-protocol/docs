## The process of providing liquidity to a Cover Position

    This is the basis for hedging risk. The equivalent of a stop loss.

A cover position consists of you choosing token A which you want to hedge price risk for (which you currently hold in your wallet) and token B to receive in the event one of the trigger prices for your stop loss are met, this token B is also used as the unit to price token B.
