# How to Swap

## Here’s the process of executing a swap on Poolshark.

    This is the basis for all trading. The equivalent of a market order. 

A swap consists of you choosing a token you want receive and a token that you currently have in your wallet and executing a trade. As said above this requires you to have tokens in your wallet.

1 . Click ‘Connect Wallet’.
